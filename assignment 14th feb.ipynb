    "Multithreading is a threading technique to run multiple threads concurrently by rapidly switching between threads with a CPU help (called context switching). Besides, it allows sharing of its data space with the main threads inside a process that share information and communication with other threads easier than individual processes. Multithreading aims to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, which increases performance, speed and improves the rendering of the application.\n",

    "It is a very useful technique for time-saving and improving the performance of an application. Multithreading allows the programmer to divide application tasks into sub-tasks and simultaneously run them in a program. It allows threads to communicate and share resources such as files, data, and memory to the same processor. Furthermore, it increases the user's responsiveness to continue running a program even if a part of the application is the length or blocked.\n",
